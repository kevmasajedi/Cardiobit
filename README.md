# CardioBit
## A Smart, Opensource and Affordable Electrocardiography Platform
CardioBit is an architecture for building IoT capable, precise, scalable and cost-efficient ECG Devices. IoT-capability and affordability are the central dogmas of this architecture. This is mainly achieved by using opensource hardware, minimum reliance on specialty components, offloading signal processing tasks to the server and avoiding the use of costly isolation component yet ensuing safety by relying solely on battery power.
