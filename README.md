# CardioBit
## A Smart, Opensource and Affordable Electrocardiography Platform
CardioBit is an architecture for building IoT capable, precise, scalable and cost-efficient ECG Devices. IoT-capability and affordability are the central dogmas of this architecture. This is mainly achieved by using opensource hardware, minimum reliance on specialty components, offloading signal processing tasks to the server and avoiding the use of costly isolation components - yet ensuing safety by relying solely on battery power.

## Introduction
In the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, in many countries throughout the world, medical infrastructure is seriously overwhelmed by a novel coronavirus. The vast majority of medical equipment are heavily patented and are sold in small volumes. Further, there is evidence that some entities actively prevented medical treatments from being deployed, even in the current pandemic. This model obviously fails during critical times. On the other hand, deployment of opensource hardware and software platforms, can result in significant cost reduction as well as increased critical preparedness.

The potential of opensource platforms to facilitate the formation of inclusive, potentially worldwide research communities, have also captured my imagination. Economically
viable solutions can be derived out of the core architecture discussed here, and can be manufactured and deployed throughout the world, in a distributed fashion. In additon, a 12-lead proof-of-concept hardware is provided.


## Background
Readers are assumed to have a minimal background in physiology and electrical engineering. Namely, they are assumed to be familiar with the basic morphological characteristics of electrocardiogram and their physiological significance, and familiarity with ohmâ€™s law, impedance, basic circuit theory, RC analog filters and basic operational amplifier circuits. However, prospective readers are encouraged to continue, as proper reference for further consultation is given in due course. For introductory topics in cardiac physiology see (Guyton and Hall 2015), and for basic introduction to electrical engineering concepts regard (Scherz and Monk 2016) and (Mancini and Carter 2009)
